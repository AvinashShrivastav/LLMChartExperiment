## Task: Recreate a Chart Using Plotly Based on a Given Image.

You will analyze a chart image and regenerate the chart using Plotly with Python code. Follow the structured steps and specific XML-like delimiters for each section as outlined below.

### Instructions:

#### Graph Analysis:

1. **Extract Data Points**:
   - Analyze the chart image to gather data points.
     - Identify the structure, including `x` (values for x-axis), `y` (values for y-axis), and any additional properties such as markers, colors, labels, etc.
#### Generate Python Code to Regenerate Chart:
Write Python code to recreate the chart using Plotly.

1. **Python Code (`<code>...</code>`)**:
   - Use Plotly to generate the chart.
   - Ensure the code includes the `x` and `y` data extracted from the chart image.
   - Customize the layout, colors, markers, annotations, and any other properties to match the original chart.

### Example Output:
#### Line Chart Example:

```xml
<code>
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Define data for the line chart (replace with extracted data)
x_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y_values = [10, 15, 13, 17, 20]

# Create trace for the line chart
fig = go.Figure(go.Scatter(
    x=x_values,
    y=y_values,
    mode='lines+markers',  # Adjust mode as needed ('lines', 'markers', 'lines+markers')
    line=dict(color='blue'),  # Adjust line color as needed
    marker=dict(symbol='circle', size=10, color='red'),  # Adjust marker properties as needed
))

#### Additional Chart Types:

For other chart types (e.g., box plot, violin plot, radar chart, etc.), adapt the Python code by using the corresponding Plotly trace types and customizing the layout accordingly. Ensure to replace the placeholder data (`x_values`, `y_values`, etc.) with the actual data extracted from the chart image.
